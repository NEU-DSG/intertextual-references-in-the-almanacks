This git repository builds on Sarah Campbell and Zheng-yan Yu’s visualization [“In the Text of Women Writers”](https://wwp.northeastern.edu/lab/names-viz/index.html), published by the [Northeastern University Women Writers Project](https://wwp.northeastern.edu). The original repository can be found on GitHub at <https://github.com/sarahsoup/wwo>.
