# Women Writers Online Collection

This visualization represents the textbase of women writers online, a collection of 401 electronically-encoded historical texts by women writers. The right-sided visualization shows a holistic view of the collection by genre and publication year. The center visualization is a bipartite network showing the relationship of words and phrases of a particular in-text element to the genre of the text it resides in. Four in-text elements are included in the visualization and are populated by clicking the respective button. The third piece is a list of the texts included in the collection. The intention is that with increased user interaction, the user can filter down to a smaller number of texts and can see them in the right column.
