      <p id="model-firstp">This project was designed and developed by Sarah Campbell and Zheng-yan Yu, who are graduate students in the
        <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/visualization/" target="_blank">Information Design and Visualization</a>
        MFA program at Northeastern University. The project was developed as a part of the course
        <a href="https://codydunne.github.io/cs7295-f17/" target="_blank">CS 7295 Special Topics in Data Visualization</a>,
         taught by <a href="https://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/people/cody-dunne/" target="_blank">Cody Dunne</a>.
        <a href="https://library.northeastern.edu/about/library-staff-directory/sarah-connell" target="_blank">Sarah Connell</a>,
        Assistant Director of the <a href="https://wwp.northeastern.edu">Women Writers Project</a>
        at the Northeastern <a href="https://dsg.neu.edu/" target="_blank">Digital Scholarship Group</a>,
        served as the project partner. Both Cody and Sarah Connell provided resources, feedback, and subject matter expertise.

      <h4>How to Explore</h4>
      <p>
        This visualization includes multiple interactions to enable user exploration:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>click through the three buttons to visualize one of the three highlighted in-text elements</li>
          <li>hover over a filled circle in the scatterplot, the text in the network visualization, or a text in the list
            to see the corresponding information across the three components</li>
          <li>click on the text in the list to see the text in full on the WWO website</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Methodology</h4>
      <p>
        This data was queried from the Women Writers Online textbase and includes metadata for each of the 401 texts
          as well as three in-text elements. Multiple values for each element can exist in each text; for example, a text
          can have multiple person names identified. See the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/REF-ELEMENTS.html" target="_blank">TEI guidelines</a>
          documentation for more about encoding of in-text elements. Below is the original count of in-text element values:
      </p>
          <ul>
            <li>142 texts included 810 unique organization names</li>
            <li>396 texts included 19,038 unique place names</li>
            <li>399	texts included 49,311 unique person names</li>
          </ul>
      <p>
          The original queried data listed the in-text element values as one string for each text, with separators in between. We parsed
          the data so there existed a row for each combination of text and in-text element value; if a text included 10
          person names, there would be one line for each name. We then manually aggregated values that were common, like
          Catholic Church and Catholike Church. These aggregations were based on sense and were not completed for the entirety
          of the data, but were completed enough in order to truly show the most frequent in-text element values.
          We visualized the top 20 values for each in-text element and their relationship to texts they reside in.
